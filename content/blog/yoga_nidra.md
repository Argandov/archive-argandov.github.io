Sometime ago, I embarked on a journey to try to calm down my very, very busy mind. The kind of mind that thinks all day long, sometimes making it almost impossible to settle things and focus on one single thing until its completion. If you are an overthinker like me, you can have bouts of intense focus and clarity coupled with infinite creativity, and the ability to grind for 12 hours straight, all with its downside: Some periods of rumination, intense anxiety and a general overwhelming feeling, and cronic procrastination that can last for hours, days, weeks... So it's a rollercoaster.

I could share a lot of insights I've gained through meditation, studying philosophy from Daoism to Stoicism, but the most direct and practical way of achieving a calm and open state I've found, has been through a quick body-scan and detached meditation, called "YOGA NIDRA". Not the kind of Yoga that needs a mat and special, physical movements.

in fact, it's the contrary.

First heard about it from Dr. Andrew Huberman, who has been using this type of ***meditation*** for years now and has some conclusive results with it.

I'm not a neuroscientist or even a Yogi (maybe someday, who knows), so let's get to the point and actually have some material to work with:

Some people practice 10 minute rituals twice a day (Before going to bed and in the morning), but personally I do it right before bed, achieving the deepest relaxation possible. All the anxiety and day-to-day turmoil go away in just the same way it feels when the refrigerator "hum" goes away. The whole point of this "skill" is to train ourselves to relax (Quite ironic, I know), and "let go", letting our bodies/minds do their healing without "us" getting in the way, adding up cortisol and unnecessary physical reactions to (Sometimes also unnecessary) thoughts.
