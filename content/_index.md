##### Made by a Cybersecurity enthusiast, for Cybersecurity enthusiasts!

**Ethos:**

I never aimed at writing, and even less about writing for a wide public, but the written word is very powerful. So, I decided to share what I know, the resources I've found, because I believe hoarding valuable information is of no use to anyone. If you're interested in gaining some skills, this website was made by a person like you, for you. Nothing more.

This site is an ambitious project, that started as a resource notebook for myself. The intention now is to make it, with time, a full *resource hub*. Like a "brain backup", which we can access from anywhere and anytime we ~~forget something~~ need to engage in an activity and some information is needed. This, with some blog posts.

So it's an esoteric dark arts library, which is also a self-development blog. :)

If you find this contents relevant and useful, feel free to treat this website as your *resource hub* too, and share it with someone you think would benefit from it.

English is not my native language, but IT was developed mostly by english-speaking people, so even low-level computer instructions were designed with english words. That's why it made perfect sense to start this project in its original language, without missing a single techy term in translation :)
