      <description>Important: This following guide assumes your activities will be low-risk, so the isolation is kept at some degree lightly. If you have some advanced and specific needs, this guide may come short and you may need to do some more research. In this case, we would need to take some extra steps to fully isolate our environment, and this post would become very extensive, so keep that in mind.
There are tons of tools available to effectively compartmentalize our virtual machines (From Type 1 or &amp;ldquo;bare metal&amp;rdquo; like VMware&amp;rsquo;s ESXi or even Qubes OS to Type 2 or &amp;ldquo;hosted&amp;rdquo; like virtual Box or VMware).</description>

      <description>In order for us to have a friendly interface for analizing network capture files (pcap), it&amp;rsquo;s very useful to have monitoring tools like Network Miner, which lets us extract the data in transit as it happened at the time of the capture. It also allows us to &amp;ldquo;sniff&amp;rdquo; communications in real time but for this time we will only be using it for reading an already existing .pcap file.
What is Network Miner anyways?</description>
